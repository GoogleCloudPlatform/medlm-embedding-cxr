# Google Cloud MedLM Embedding API For CXR 

## Overview

This notebook demostrates the usage of the [CXR](https://github.com/Google-Health/imaging-research/blob/master/cxr-foundation/) foundation model, now hosted through the Google Cloud MedLM Embedding API. This foundation model can accelerate the development and deployment of machine learning vision models that require understanding of chest x-ray imaging features.
